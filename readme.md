# Automation with Google Apps Scripts
This is a sample of an automation project on Google Drive with Google Apps scripts.
This specific use case is for a journalism organization.

## Page Alert
Page alert connects to Slack's API in order to send a page whenever specific progress has been made on designing a page. An editor/advisor will then be notified of the progress on the page.

## Major Control Panel
This is a "Master Control Panel" that allows for the creation of many different files (Docs, Sheets, Forms), all organized into one folder that is named the current year.
One of the spreadsheets created by this control panel is another control panel within the created folder, that creates more spreadsheet based on templates copied by the master control panel for a specific cycle.
